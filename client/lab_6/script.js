  ## JS and HTML Injection
    There are a bunch of methods to inject text or HTML into a document using JS
    Mainly, they're considered "unsafe" because they can spoof a page pretty easily
    But they're useful for starting to understand how websites work
    the usual ones are element.innerText and element.innerHTML
    Here's an article on the differences if you want to know more:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent#differences_from_innertext

  ## What to do in this function
    - Accept a list of restaurant objects
    - using a .forEach method, inject a list element into your index.html for every element in the list
    - Display the name of that restaurant and what category of food it is
*/
}

  return list.filter((item) => {
    const lowerCaseName = item.name.toLowerCase();
    const lowerCaseQuery = query.toLowerCase();
    return lowerCaseName.includes(lowerCaseQuery); //includes evaluates == 
  }) 
}


async function mainEvent() { // the async keyword means we can make API requests
  const form = document.querySelector('.main_form'); // This class name needs to be set on your form before you can listen for an event on it
  const filterButton = document.querySelector('.filter_button');
  
  let currentList = [];
  
  form.addEventListener('submit', async (submitEvent) => { // async has to be declared on every function that needs to "await" something
    submitEvent.preventDefault(); // This prevents your page from going to http://localhost:3000/api even if your form still has an action set on it
    console.log('form submission'); // this is substituting for a "breakpoint"

    // this is the preferred way to handle form data in JS in 2022
    const formData = new FormData(submitEvent.target); // get the data from the listener target
    const formProps = Object.fromEntries(formData); // Turn it into an object

    //get request to control results
    const results = await fetch('https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/umjn-t2iz.json');

    // This changes the response from the GET into data we can use - an "object"

/*
  This adds an event listener that fires our main event only once our page elements have loaded
  The use of the async keyword means we can "await" events before continuing in our scripts
  In this case, we load some data when the form has submitted

    ## Process Data Separately From Injecting It
      This function should accept your 1,000 records
      then select 15 random records
      and return an object containing only the restaurant's name, category, and geocoded location
      So we can inject them using the HTML injection function

      You can find the column names by carefully looking at your single returned record
      https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz

    ## What to do in this function:

    - Create an array of 15 empty elements (there are a lot of fun ways to do this, and also very basic ways)
    - using a .map function on that range,
    - Make a list of 15 random restaurants from your list of 100 from your data request
    - Return only their name, category, and location
    - Return the new list of 15 restaurants so we can work on it separately in the HTML injector
